    Data is first downloaded from GitHub and the [f1db](https://github.com/f1db/f1db) repo. CSV's
    are extracted from the newest release and inserted into the existing dbt structure.

    DuckDB is utilized to store the data.

    dbt is used to:
    - load the inital raw CSV's into the `raw` schema.
    - create `core` [silver layer tables](https://github.com/lucasasmith/f1-analytics/tree/main/f1_analytics/models/core).
    - create `reporing` [gold layer views](https://github.com/lucasasmith/f1-analytics/tree/main/f1_analytics/models/reporting).
    - run data tests (verifying primary keys, ranges, etc.)
